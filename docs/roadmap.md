1. **JSON-Structured Output**

   * Add a `-LiteralJson` flag that dumps the snapshot and repair plan as JSON. This makes it easy to consume in CI pipelines or other automation tools.

2. **System-Level Association Support**

   * Extend your snapshot logic to also check (and optionally repair) HKLM associations (e.g. under `HKCR`) so corporate or machine-wide defaults are covered, not just user-level keys.

3. **“Clean” Interactive Preview**

   * Offer an interactive mode (`-WhatIfInteractive`) where, after a dry-run, you prompt the user to confirm each individual fix before applying it.

4. **Logging and Transcripts**

   * Wire in `Start-Transcript`/`Stop-Transcript` or a dedicated logging module so users can capture full audit runs to a file for later review.

5. **Module Packaging & CI**

   * Convert the scripts into a proper PowerShell module with a `.psd1` manifest, publish to the PowerShell Gallery, and set up a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs your Pester tests on every push.

6. **Expand Test Coverage**

   * Add Pester tests for:

     * Reading the default value via `.GetValue('')`
     * Snapshots with no registry keys present
     * Populating and validating `HandlerPaths` entries
     * Simulated clean vs. actual clean

7. **Error Handling & Reporting**

   * Surface specific error codes or structured errors when registry access fails (e.g. access denied vs. key missing), so callers can react programmatically.

8. **Bulk / File-Path Mode**

   * Allow passing a file path (not just an extension) and automatically extract its extension, or handle multiple extensions in one run (e.g. `-Path .txt,.md`).

9. **Localization / Internationalization**

   * Abstract all output strings into a resource file so you can add translations later (e.g. Spanish, German).

10. **Telemetry-Ready Hooks**

    * Add an opt-in “report usage” endpoint or log hook so you can collect anonymous stats on which extensions are most commonly audited/cleaned.

11. **Backup Verification**

    * After creating the `.reg` backup, parse it or test-import into a throwaway registry hive to verify it was valid before proceeding.

12. **Enhance Documentation**

    * Add a “Troubleshooting” section covering common failures (e.g. UWP ProgID quirks) and register a help file (`.xml`) so `Get-Help ftype-audit` works out of the box.
